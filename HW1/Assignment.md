# Part 1

Using AIML create a chatbot that can do the following:

- greet the user,
- use the user name in greetings if the user declares it,
- conduct a conversation of at least three exchanges across two topics.
- support at least 5 different questions per topic. 

When it doesn't understand the topic the chatbot behaves like a Rogerian psychotherapist  

You can use local AIML parsers or the free Pandora one.

Upload AIML files at: https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/cse590b-sp21/assignments/a1/ (Links to an external site.)<your netid>

Please include a **readme** file with the topics that your chatbot support, 5 sample questions that can be answered by your chatbot under each topic. If you used anything special(e.g. did you used Pandora or any local parsers), please specify with information that one may need in order to interact with it.
